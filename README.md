Welcome to my Shell Scripting Progress repository! üöÄ

This repository serves as a documentation of my journey into the world of shell scripting. Here, you'll find a collection of scripts, notes, and resources that I've accumulated as I dive deeper into mastering shell scripting.

Purpose
The primary goal of this repository is to track my progress and development as I enhance my shell scripting skills. Whether it's creating simple utilities, automating tasks, or tackling more complex challenges, each script represents a step forward in my understanding and proficiency in shell scripting.

Structure
Scripts: This directory contains the shell scripts I've created during my learning process. From basic concepts to advanced techniques, each script showcases different aspects of shell scripting.
Notes: In this directory, you'll find my personal notes, tips, and tricks related to shell scripting. These notes serve as a reference and a source of learning for myself and others.
Resources: Here, I've gathered useful resources, tutorials, and articles that have helped me in my journey. Feel free to explore and utilize these resources to enhance your own shell scripting skills.
Future Plans
My ultimate aim is to culminate this journey with the creation of a comprehensive and efficient shell script, encapsulating the skills and knowledge I've gained throughout this process. This script will represent not only the culmination of my learning but also a practical demonstration of my ability to utilize shell scripting to solve real-world problems.
